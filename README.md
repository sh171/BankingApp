# Banking App

## Overview
The Banking App simulates a real-world banking experience. Users can kick-start their journey by inputting initial account details, then interact with their virtual bank account to view details, deposit funds, withdraw money, and more.

## Description
The Banking App is built with interactivity at its core:

- Account Initialization: The journey commences with users entering their account information. This initial data helps in crafting the state of the bank account.
- Interactive Interface: Users can actively engage with their bank account state through the interface, both reading from and writing to their account data.
- Event-Driven Actions: The application prominently features buttons that act as the primary event listeners. Each button press corresponds to a particular function, executing predefined actions seamlessly.

With an emphasis on button clicks, the application has been designed to harness several event listeners, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.
