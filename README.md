# Banking App
This banking account application is that simulates a sequence of actions where users input initial data, send that information to a bank account, view bank details, and perform actions like withdrawing money, depositing money, or increasing funds.

## Description
In this banking account application, we will primarily rely on button clicks and create several event listeners throughout the program. Initially, we will create the state of the bank account based on the account information entered into the input tags, and users will interact with this state on the interface by reading and writing data.

This interface will also include buttons, which serve as the main event listeners. Whenever a user clicks a button, a specific function will be executed to perform certain actions.
